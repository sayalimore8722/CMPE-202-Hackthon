Team Project Gas pump station(Demo Video link: https://youtu.be/ma_XtUe7w2Q


A gas pump machine contains a numeric keypad, a credit card reader (with receipt printer) and a display screen with two rows of four buttons (as shown below).  The two rows of buttons map to available options displayed on the screen for customers to select. Options displayed on the screen depends on which step the machine is currently on while waiting for customer actions.


Scenario #1:

San Francisco
	The customer goes through the steps to pump gas, selects the “Yes” option to print the receipt at then end and then drives off “Happy”.

Scenario #2:
San Jose
The gas station is equipped with a car wash and offers a discounted Price when pumping gas with car wash, then a receipt is automatically printed at the end with the car wash code.  That is, the customer is not given the option (Yes or No) to print the receipt.

Scenario #3:
Palo Alto
A picky gas station wants to the ask the customer if they want to print a receipt at the beginning of the process rather than at the end of the process.
